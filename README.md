Steps to work on this project with css and js

1-> After downloading this repo go in the project folder and then do npm intall to install all the modules that are to be used in the project

2-> all ejs files are in views folder , you can create any new tag anywhere can give any new id or class to any element as you like but dont delete any thing without asking as it can break something

3-> all the css and js files and images that you will use are to be in css, js , images folders in public folder

4-> use  <link href="/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /> to add css file and you can make new css files or a new css file for ejs file but change name in that specific ejs file too like /css/home.css etc

5-> use <script src="/js/script.js"></script> to add js file and you can make many js files like 1.js and add them same like "/js/1.js" in the respective ejs file where its used 

**IMPORTANT**

Don't change anything that is already done untill its just a tag or some styling or anything

DOn't change any attribute setting in ejs files nor in js files as a simple /logins can crash the server as the address in /login

No changing anything in any file you are only allowed to add things according you your need

No tampering with any file ouside views and public folder
